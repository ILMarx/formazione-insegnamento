  <title>New paths for Special and Experimental Pedagogy  applied to Motor and Sports Education | Formazione &amp; insegnamento (Mirror Archive)</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The growing awareness of the importance of motor and sports activities has made it assume great relevance in different everyday life contexts, and as a result, the educational nature that sport has taken on over time has been acknowledged, thus becoming a crucial component in all the main social interaction contexts. Among the areas of pedagogical reflection that have gained considerable space in the contemporary debate in recent decades, those relating to the body, movement and sport represent a very important cross-section as specific training tools, which should be highlighted the conditions of educability necessary for sport to represent a life context oriented towards emancipation for all subjects. Through this pedagogical dimension, in fact, young people can be offered a balanced growth from a socialization point of view and aimed at healthy lifestyles, thus highlighting the positive repercussions that it generates throughout one’s life. This is why, in Italy, sports practice in the educational context, among which the university one stands out, is assuming such an importance as to be considered one of the fundamental elements to take care of both psycho-physical and educational well-being. What emerges, therefore, is the need to provide children, families and universities with clarity regarding the promotion of sports education and didacts, with particular attention to its importance in the primary, secondary and aca-demic education system, and with the arduous task of enhancing its educational, sports, preventive, cultural and social purposes. The school and university system is certainly one of the places where people meet and relate, where the person’s growth does not depend only on didactic contents, but it needs an educational offer that is varied and considers the main protagonists of social interest, and a privileged environment for the development of a social culture that starts from childhood, offering a preventive intervention capable of intervening on the whole society. For this reason, it is worth highlighting the elements and modalities that characterize the educational value of motor sciences at school and of sport in leisure time, emphasizing that education to sport must be a path that covers several dimensions. In this regard, it is essential to start from the motor activity practiced at school, up to the introduction to sport and finally to its professional practice, in order to allow everyone to find his/her place and to work according to the maturity of his/her motor function and learning levels. Motor practice must be regarded as a tool for manifesting and training one’s potentials. Therefore, in the formal training dimension, it is fundamental precisely because the contents are subject to an active type of learning and to an effective participation, significantly incorporated through association mechanisms between the students’ cognitive dimension and motor potentials. The integration of motor and sports activity carried out in the educational context with the one that is practiced every day at an extracurricular level, has led to clear successes: students appear to be more focused in the classroom and more able to learn, demonstrating that the school/university-sport synergy is a valuable support for the teaching-learning pair, participating in major social challenges such as health and well-being improvement, management of conflict situations and inclusion of people with dis-abilities and from different cultural backgrounds. This issue plays a central role for the whole school and university education system, which increasingly deals with a heterogeneous environment with many social, psycho-physical and cultural differences; this system is called upon to equally guarantee the pursuit of both the “learning” and the “inclusion” objectives. In order to include students with disabilities, it is essential to remember that the fundamental objective of Italian Law n. 104/92, art. 12, par. 3, is the development of learning through communication, socialization and interpersonal relationships. Therefore, the educational project for students with disabilities, which can be extended to all those who are marked by diversity with respect to the peer group, must be developed with this priority in mind. An educational project based on the principle of the individual’s right to study and formation, also according to the logic of building a life project that allows the student to “have a future”, can only be defined within inclusive work groups. The Disabled person is included in a context in which he/she experiences and learns with others, when he/she shares objectives and work strategies and not when he/she lives, works and sits only next to others without playing an active role. In this regard, all approaches to educational work defined as innovative are of considerable interest, which, by adopting techniques and technologies, guarantee the centrality of the student, whether disabled or non-disabled, stimulating his/her active participation and improving his/her learning and training levels. The educational and training aspects concerning students, special pedagogical approaches, the main innovative teaching techniques and methodologies, and the motor and sports education fields, are deepened with clarity and effectiveness within this Special Issue, which stands as a valuable contribution to research in the field of didactic, pedagogical, motor and sports sciences.">

    <meta name="DC.Title" xml:lang="it" content="Nuovi percorsi per la Pedagogia Speciale  e Sperimentale applicata all’Educazione Motoria e Sportiva">
    <meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="it" content="La crescente consapevolezza dell&#39;importanza dell&#39;attività motoria e sportiva le ha fatto assumere grande rilevanza nei diversi contesti della vita quotidiana e, di conseguenza, è stata riconosciuta la natura educativa che lo sport ha assunto nel tempo, diventando così una componente cruciale in tutte le principali contesti di interazione sociale. Tra gli ambiti di riflessione pedagogica che hanno guadagnato notevole spazio nel dibattito contemporaneo degli ultimi decenni, quelli relativi al corpo, al movimento e allo sport rappresentano uno spaccato molto importante in quanto specifici strumenti formativi, sui quali vanno evidenziate le condizioni di educabilità necessarie per lo sport a rappresentare un contesto di vita orientato all&#39;emancipazione per tutti i soggetti. Attraverso questa dimensione pedagogica, infatti, si può offrire ai giovani una crescita equilibrata dal punto di vista della socializzazione e finalizzata a sani stili di vita, evidenziando così le ricadute positive che essa genera lungo tutto l&#39;arco della vita. Ecco perché, in Italia, la pratica sportiva in ambito educativo, tra cui spicca quella universitaria, sta assumendo un&#39;importanza tale da essere considerata uno degli elementi fondamentali per prendersi cura del benessere sia psico-fisico che educativo. Emerge, quindi, la necessità di fornire ai ragazzi, alle famiglie e alle università chiarezza in merito alla promozione dell&#39;educazione e della didattica sportiva, con particolare attenzione alla sua importanza nel sistema di istruzione primaria, secondaria e accademica, e all&#39;arduo compito di valorizzandone le finalità educative, sportive, preventive, culturali e sociali. Il sistema scolastico e universitario è certamente uno dei luoghi di incontro e di relazione, dove la crescita della persona non dipende solo dai contenuti didattici, ma necessita di un&#39;offerta formativa variegata e che consideri i principali protagonisti dell&#39;interesse sociale, e di un privilegiato ambiente per lo sviluppo di una cultura sociale che parta dall&#39;infanzia, offrendo un intervento preventivo capace di intervenire sull&#39;intera società. Per questo vale la pena evidenziare gli elementi e le modalità che caratterizzano il valore educativo delle scienze motorie a scuola e dello sport nel tempo libero, sottolineando che l&#39;educazione allo sport deve essere un percorso che abbraccia più dimensioni. A questo proposito, è fondamentale partire dall&#39;attività motoria praticata a scuola, fino all&#39;introduzione allo sport e infine alla sua pratica professionale, al fine di permettere a ciascuno di trovare il proprio posto e di lavorare secondo la maturità del proprio /la sua funzione motoria e i livelli di apprendimento. La pratica motoria deve essere considerata come uno strumento per manifestare e allenare le proprie potenzialità. Pertanto, nella dimensione della formazione formale, è fondamentale proprio perché i contenuti sono soggetti ad un apprendimento di tipo attivo e ad una partecipazione effettiva, significativamente incorporati attraverso meccanismi di associazione tra dimensione cognitiva degli studenti e potenzialità motorie. L&#39;integrazione dell&#39;attività motoria e sportiva svolta nel contesto educativo con quella praticata quotidianamente a livello extrascolastico, ha portato a evidenti successi: gli studenti risultano essere più concentrati in classe e più capaci di apprendere, a dimostrazione che la la sinergia scuola/università-sport è un valido supporto per il binomio insegnamento-apprendimento, partecipando alle grandi sfide sociali come il miglioramento della salute e del benessere, la gestione delle situazioni conflittuali e l&#39;inclusione di persone con disabilità e di diversa estrazione culturale. Questo tema riveste un ruolo centrale per l&#39;intero sistema educativo scolastico e universitario, che sempre più si confronta con un ambiente eterogeneo con molte differenze sociali, psico-fisiche e culturali; tale sistema è chiamato a garantire in egual misura il perseguimento sia degli obiettivi di “apprendimento” che di “inclusione”. Al fine di includere gli studenti con disabilità, è essenziale ricordare che l&#39;obiettivo fondamentale della legge italiana n. 104/92, all&#39;art. 12, par. 3, è lo sviluppo dell&#39;apprendimento attraverso la comunicazione, la socializzazione e le relazioni interpersonali. Pertanto, il progetto educativo per gli studenti con disabilità, che può essere esteso a tutti coloro che sono contrassegnati dalla diversità rispetto al gruppo dei pari, deve essere sviluppato con questa priorità. Un progetto educativo fondato sul principio del diritto individuale allo studio e alla formazione, anche secondo la logica della costruzione di un progetto di vita che consenta allo studente di “avere un futuro”, può definirsi solo all&#39;interno di gruppi di lavoro inclusivi. La persona disabile è inserita in un contesto in cui fa esperienza e apprende con gli altri, quando condivide obiettivi e strategie di lavoro e non quando vive, lavora e si siede solo accanto agli altri senza svolgere un ruolo attivo. A questo proposito, sono di notevole interesse tutti gli approcci al lavoro educativo definiti innovativi che, adottando tecniche e tecnologie, garantiscono la centralità dello studente, disabile e non, stimolando la sua partecipazione attiva e migliorando la sua livelli di apprendimento e formazione. Gli aspetti educativi e formativi riguardanti gli studenti, gli approcci pedagogici speciali, le principali tecniche e metodologie didattiche innovative, gli ambiti dell&#39;educazione motoria e sportiva, sono approfonditi con chiarezza ed efficacia all&#39;interno di questo Numero Speciale, che si pone come un prezioso contributo alla ricerca nel settore delle scienze didattiche, pedagogiche, motorie e sportive.">

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> New paths for Special and Experimental Pedagogy  applied to Motor and Sports Education</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The growing awareness of the importance of motor and sports activities has made it assume great relevance in different everyday life contexts, and as a result, the educational nature that sport has taken on over time has been acknowledged, thus becoming a crucial component in all the main social interaction contexts. Among the areas of pedagogical reflection that have gained considerable space in the contemporary debate in recent decades, those relating to the body, movement and sport represent a very important cross-section as specific training tools, which should be highlighted the conditions of educability necessary for sport to represent a life context oriented towards emancipation for all subjects. Through this pedagogical dimension, in fact, young people can be offered a balanced growth from a socialization point of view and aimed at healthy lifestyles, thus highlighting the positive repercussions that it generates throughout one’s life. This is why, in Italy, sports practice in the educational context, among which the university one stands out, is assuming such an importance as to be considered one of the fundamental elements to take care of both psycho-physical and educational well-being. What emerges, therefore, is the need to provide children, families and universities with clarity regarding the promotion of sports education and didacts, with particular attention to its importance in the primary, secondary and aca-demic education system, and with the arduous task of enhancing its educational, sports, preventive, cultural and social purposes. The school and university system is certainly one of the places where people meet and relate, where the person’s growth does not depend only on didactic contents, but it needs an educational offer that is varied and considers the main protagonists of social interest, and a privileged environment for the development of a social culture that starts from childhood, offering a preventive intervention capable of intervening on the whole society. For this reason, it is worth highlighting the elements and modalities that characterize the educational value of motor sciences at school and of sport in leisure time, emphasizing that education to sport must be a path that covers several dimensions. In this regard, it is essential to start from the motor activity practiced at school, up to the introduction to sport and finally to its professional practice, in order to allow everyone to find his/her place and to work according to the maturity of his/her motor function and learning levels. Motor practice must be regarded as a tool for manifesting and training one’s potentials. Therefore, in the formal training dimension, it is fundamental precisely because the contents are subject to an active type of learning and to an effective participation, significantly incorporated through association mechanisms between the students’ cognitive dimension and motor potentials. The integration of motor and sports activity carried out in the educational context with the one that is practiced every day at an extracurricular level, has led to clear successes: students appear to be more focused in the classroom and more able to learn, demonstrating that the school/university-sport synergy is a valuable support for the teaching-learning pair, participating in major social challenges such as health and well-being improvement, management of conflict situations and inclusion of people with dis-abilities and from different cultural backgrounds. This issue plays a central role for the whole school and university education system, which increasingly deals with a heterogeneous environment with many social, psycho-physical and cultural differences; this system is called upon to equally guarantee the pursuit of both the “learning” and the “inclusion” objectives. In order to include students with disabilities, it is essential to remember that the fundamental objective of Italian Law n. 104/92, art. 12, par. 3, is the development of learning through communication, socialization and interpersonal relationships. Therefore, the educational project for students with disabilities, which can be extended to all those who are marked by diversity with respect to the peer group, must be developed with this priority in mind. An educational project based on the principle of the individual’s right to study and formation, also according to the logic of building a life project that allows the student to “have a future”, can only be defined within inclusive work groups. The Disabled person is included in a context in which he/she experiences and learns with others, when he/she shares objectives and work strategies and not when he/she lives, works and sits only next to others without playing an active role. In this regard, all approaches to educational work defined as innovative are of considerable interest, which, by adopting techniques and technologies, guarantee the centrality of the student, whether disabled or non-disabled, stimulating his/her active participation and improving his/her learning and training levels. The educational and training aspects concerning students, special pedagogical approaches, the main innovative teaching techniques and methodologies, and the motor and sports education fields, are deepened with clarity and effectiveness within this Special Issue, which stands as a valuable contribution to research in the field of didactic, pedagogical, motor and sports sciences.</p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Nuovi percorsi per la Pedagogia Speciale  e Sperimentale applicata all’Educazione Motoria e Sportiva</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> La crescente consapevolezza dell&#39;importanza dell&#39;attività motoria e sportiva le ha fatto assumere grande rilevanza nei diversi contesti della vita quotidiana e, di conseguenza, è stata riconosciuta la natura educativa che lo sport ha assunto nel tempo, diventando così una componente cruciale in tutte le principali contesti di interazione sociale. Tra gli ambiti di riflessione pedagogica che hanno guadagnato notevole spazio nel dibattito contemporaneo degli ultimi decenni, quelli relativi al corpo, al movimento e allo sport rappresentano uno spaccato molto importante in quanto specifici strumenti formativi, sui quali vanno evidenziate le condizioni di educabilità necessarie per lo sport a rappresentare un contesto di vita orientato all&#39;emancipazione per tutti i soggetti. Attraverso questa dimensione pedagogica, infatti, si può offrire ai giovani una crescita equilibrata dal punto di vista della socializzazione e finalizzata a sani stili di vita, evidenziando così le ricadute positive che essa genera lungo tutto l&#39;arco della vita. Ecco perché, in Italia, la pratica sportiva in ambito educativo, tra cui spicca quella universitaria, sta assumendo un&#39;importanza tale da essere considerata uno degli elementi fondamentali per prendersi cura del benessere sia psico-fisico che educativo. Emerge, quindi, la necessità di fornire ai ragazzi, alle famiglie e alle università chiarezza in merito alla promozione dell&#39;educazione e della didattica sportiva, con particolare attenzione alla sua importanza nel sistema di istruzione primaria, secondaria e accademica, e all&#39;arduo compito di valorizzandone le finalità educative, sportive, preventive, culturali e sociali. Il sistema scolastico e universitario è certamente uno dei luoghi di incontro e di relazione, dove la crescita della persona non dipende solo dai contenuti didattici, ma necessita di un&#39;offerta formativa variegata e che consideri i principali protagonisti dell&#39;interesse sociale, e di un privilegiato ambiente per lo sviluppo di una cultura sociale che parta dall&#39;infanzia, offrendo un intervento preventivo capace di intervenire sull&#39;intera società. Per questo vale la pena evidenziare gli elementi e le modalità che caratterizzano il valore educativo delle scienze motorie a scuola e dello sport nel tempo libero, sottolineando che l&#39;educazione allo sport deve essere un percorso che abbraccia più dimensioni. A questo proposito, è fondamentale partire dall&#39;attività motoria praticata a scuola, fino all&#39;introduzione allo sport e infine alla sua pratica professionale, al fine di permettere a ciascuno di trovare il proprio posto e di lavorare secondo la maturità del proprio /la sua funzione motoria e i livelli di apprendimento. La pratica motoria deve essere considerata come uno strumento per manifestare e allenare le proprie potenzialità. Pertanto, nella dimensione della formazione formale, è fondamentale proprio perché i contenuti sono soggetti ad un apprendimento di tipo attivo e ad una partecipazione effettiva, significativamente incorporati attraverso meccanismi di associazione tra dimensione cognitiva degli studenti e potenzialità motorie. L&#39;integrazione dell&#39;attività motoria e sportiva svolta nel contesto educativo con quella praticata quotidianamente a livello extrascolastico, ha portato a evidenti successi: gli studenti risultano essere più concentrati in classe e più capaci di apprendere, a dimostrazione che la la sinergia scuola/università-sport è un valido supporto per il binomio insegnamento-apprendimento, partecipando alle grandi sfide sociali come il miglioramento della salute e del benessere, la gestione delle situazioni conflittuali e l&#39;inclusione di persone con disabilità e di diversa estrazione culturale. Questo tema riveste un ruolo centrale per l&#39;intero sistema educativo scolastico e universitario, che sempre più si confronta con un ambiente eterogeneo con molte differenze sociali, psico-fisiche e culturali; tale sistema è chiamato a garantire in egual misura il perseguimento sia degli obiettivi di “apprendimento” che di “inclusione”. Al fine di includere gli studenti con disabilità, è essenziale ricordare che l&#39;obiettivo fondamentale della legge italiana n. 104/92, all&#39;art. 12, par. 3, è lo sviluppo dell&#39;apprendimento attraverso la comunicazione, la socializzazione e le relazioni interpersonali. Pertanto, il progetto educativo per gli studenti con disabilità, che può essere esteso a tutti coloro che sono contrassegnati dalla diversità rispetto al gruppo dei pari, deve essere sviluppato con questa priorità. Un progetto educativo fondato sul principio del diritto individuale allo studio e alla formazione, anche secondo la logica della costruzione di un progetto di vita che consenta allo studente di “avere un futuro”, può definirsi solo all&#39;interno di gruppi di lavoro inclusivi. La persona disabile è inserita in un contesto in cui fa esperienza e apprende con gli altri, quando condivide obiettivi e strategie di lavoro e non quando vive, lavora e si siede solo accanto agli altri senza svolgere un ruolo attivo. A questo proposito, sono di notevole interesse tutti gli approcci al lavoro educativo definiti innovativi che, adottando tecniche e tecnologie, garantiscono la centralità dello studente, disabile e non, stimolando la sua partecipazione attiva e migliorando la sua livelli di apprendimento e formazione. Gli aspetti educativi e formativi riguardanti gli studenti, gli approcci pedagogici speciali, le principali tecniche e metodologie didattiche innovative, gli ambiti dell&#39;educazione motoria e sportiva, sono approfonditi con chiarezza ed efficacia all&#39;interno di questo Numero Speciale, che si pone come un prezioso contributo alla ricerca nel settore delle scienze didattiche, pedagogiche, motorie e sportive.</p>
